1. Intro                                                          *gist-intro*

Gist.vim, as expected, is a plugin for creating gists straight from Vim.
Gist.vim requires Vim to be compiled with +python.

This plugin adds two commands which are explained later:

    :Gist
    :GistOpenLast


==============================================================================

2. Usage                                                          *gist-usage*

The two commands are relatively simple. First off:

    :Gist [-pPao] [DESCRIPTION]
    :'<,'>Gist [-pPao] [DESCRIPTION]

This takes multiple options each with have a long and short flag.

    --public: This creates a public Gist. This is the default.
              See |gist_default_private| to change this default.

    --private: This creates a private gist. Public is the default.
               See |gist_default_private| to change this default.

    --anonymous: Create a anonymous gist.

    --open: Open the created Gist in the browser after it's created.
            This is on by default.
            See |gist_open_url| to change this default.

    Description: Any other information passed on the command line will be
                 used as the description for the Gist. If nothing else is
                 passed you will be prompted for a description.

    Filenames: The filename for the gist is pulled from the filename from
               Vim.

    Range: As you can see the command can also take an optional range given
           by a visual selection. In this case only that text will be used
           for the gist.


Credentials are pulled from your ~/.netrc file. You can change the default
location with |gist_netrc_path|. They need to be in this format:

    machine <api.github.com>
        login <Username>
        password <Password>

The URL can vary based on your |gist_base_url|.


The other command is very simple:

    :GistOpenLast

This command takes no arguments. It opens the last created Gist in the
browser. This can be useful if you create an anonymous gist without opening it
immediately, or if you just want the convenience.


==============================================================================

3. Configuration Options                                  *gist-configuration*

Gist.vim allows you to configure all the default arguments for the :Gist
command.

                                                               *gist_open_url*
Default: 1
Automatically open newly created gists in the browser

                                                        *gist_default_private*
Default: 0
Create gists as private by default.

                                                             *gist_netrc_path*
Default: "~/.netrc"
The default path for the netrc file to read your Github credentials from. If
you decide to change this path make sure to give it something absolute.

                                              *gist_executable_for_<platform>*
Default: Mac:     "open"
         Linux:   ["xdg-open", "gvfs-open", "gnome-open"]
         Cygwin:  "cygstart"
         Windows: "explorer"

Use the above keywords (lowercased) and assign a single string with either a
path or just an executable (if Vim's path is correct) to use to open the
browser. Another reasonable example may be google-chrome. If the given
executable cannot be found by python through Vim an error will raised.

                                                               *gist_base_url*
Default: "https://api.github.com/"
The default API URL to try and post this gist. This is intended to be
changeable for enterprise users although I have no idea how that works.

The original awesome Gist plugin. This requires a webapi implementation by
the same author. Gist.vim depends on +python instead.
