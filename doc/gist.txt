1. Intro                                                          *gist-intro*

Gist.vim, as expected, is a plugin for creating gists straight from Vim.
Gist.vim requires Vim to be compiled with +python3.

This plugin adds two commands which are explained later:

    :Gist
    :GistOpenLast


==============================================================================

2. Usage                                                          *gist-usage*

The two commands are relatively simple. First off:

    :Gist [-pPao] [DESCRIPTION]
    :'<,'>Gist [-pPao] [DESCRIPTION]

This takes multiple options each with have a long and short flag.

    --public: This creates a public Gist. This is the default.
              See |gist_default_private| to change this default.

    --private: This creates a private gist. Public is the default.
               See |gist_default_private| to change this default.

    --open: Open the created Gist in the browser after it's created.
            This is on by default.
            See |gist_open_url| to change this default.

    Description: Any other information passed on the command line will be
                 used as the description for the Gist. If nothing else is
                 passed you will be prompted for a description.

    Filenames: The filename for the gist is pulled from the filename from
               Vim.

    Range: As you can see the command can also take an optional range given
           by a visual selection. In this case only that text will be used
           for the gist.


Credentials are pulled from your ~/.netrc file. They need to be in this
format:

    machine api.github.com
        login <Username>
        password <Password>

The URL can vary based on your |gist_base_url|.


The other commands are very simple:

    :GistOpenLast
    :GistCopyLast

These commands takes no arguments. They copy or open the last created Gist in
the browser.

3. Configuration Options                                  *gist-configuration*

Gist.vim allows you to configure all the default arguments for the :Gist
command.

                                                               *gist_open_url*
Default: 1
Automatically open newly created gists in the browser

                                                               *gist_copy_url*
Default: 0
Automatically copy newly created gist to the pasteboard

                                                          *gist_yank_register*
Default: "use clipboard register"
Choose which register the URL copy is written to

                                                        *gist_default_private*
Default: 0
Create gists as private by default.

                                                               *gist_base_url*
Default: "https://api.github.com/"
The default API URL to try and post this gist. This is intended to be
changeable for enterprise users although I have no idea how that works.

5. Related Works                                                *gist-related*

The original awesome Gist plugin. This requires a webapi implementation by
the same author. Gist.vim depends on +python3 instead.
